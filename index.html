        <p class="story-text">I discovered this corner during my first year of the bachelor's degree. The same time I met my partner. One Saturday we wanted to have lunch outside, so we made sandwiches and walked to the upper path of Lockey Park. We arrived at a bench built of stones, right in the middle of a grove without any trace of civilization and we ate. Soon we were bitten all over by mosquitoes, but I remember the experience as very romantic and peaceful.
            I lived in the nearby Senate dormitory, building 159, exactly a minute and a half away from this corner. The dormitory was also special for me because my parents lived in the same building when my father was a student at the Technion, and my mother was pregnant with me. 23 years later I moved into the same building, two floors above, closing a circle.</p>
